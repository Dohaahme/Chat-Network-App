# Chat Network App 💬🌐

A Java-based desktop chat application that allows devices to communicate over a local or wide area network. Built using network programming concepts with sockets.

## 🔧 Features
- Real-time text-based chat between devices
- Voice and video call capability
- File sharing (all file types)
- Multi-device support through socket communication
- Simple user interface

## 🛠️ Built With
- Java (Swing for UI)
- Java Sockets
- Multi-threaded programming
- TCP/IP protocol

## 📡 How It Works
This app uses **Java Sockets** to create client-server architecture. Devices connected to the same network (or via port forwarding) can exchange text messages, audio, video, and files in real time.

## 🚀 Use Cases
- Local chat between multiple PCs
- Classroom network communication
- Demonstrating Java network programming fundamentals

## 📁 Note
This project is written in Java and focuses on **network programming** concepts.  
It was developed as part of an academic project and demonstrates client-server communication using sockets.
